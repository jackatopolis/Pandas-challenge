2. Age range with the majority of purchases is ages 20-24, which comprised of 44.79% of all purchases. The next closes age ranges are ages 15-19 with 19.58% of purchases and ages 25-29 with 13.37% of purchases.
3. The item that was purchased the most, and also brought in the most revenue, was the 'Final Critic' (Item ID: 92), which was purchased 13 times and generated $59.99 in revenue, suggesting the majority of revenue comes from the variety of items and not one particular item.
